# MARS-Project
TIC TAC TOE GAME
The aim of this project is to contribute in MARS COLONIZATION PROGRAM by making a web-based application of TIC TAC TOE game using Minimax algorithm.
The design of our game consists of two parts:
1. Human vs Friend: There is again two parts.
i)OFFLINE MODE: Normal human to friend game played from one browser. 
ii)ONLINE MODE: Anyone can create a virtual room for two players to play and second player can access to same room by joining the game through same id from different device. 
In this mode, we can create an id by clicking on create button,then wait for the second player to join the room. Second player can enter the game through the same id and then the game will start.
2. Human vs Bot: This part of the game consists of three levels of difficulty. Users can enjoy the game by selecting the level as well as choice of 'O' or 'X'. If user will choose 'X', he/she will start first otherwise BOT will play the first move.

For online mode to work, we used pubnub API.
